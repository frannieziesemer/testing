## Testing Tutorial


#### Stage 1: unit test - a basic javascript test
  1. Have a look into package.json and see which testing packages are installed and how we can run tests
  2. create test file `functionName.test.js`
  3. create function file `functionName.js` with empty function
  4. TDD: write the test first
  5. run the test in terminal npm test
  3. Test will fail so write the function until the test passes
  4. refactor function if needed

#### Stage 2: component test - react testing
  1. Have a look at the app to see which react components are there. Think about what we might be able to test to make sure we are confident our app will always work how we want it to.
